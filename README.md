# Turnzer Frontend Documentation
An AI powered web app that is designed to allow users easily analyze CSV files 

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
After successfully cloning this repository, open the project your preferred text editor <br>
Open the editor's terminal and run `npm install` to install all dependencies

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, use `npm start` to start the application <br>

This runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

In the project directory, use `npm run build` to create an optimized production build of the app <br>

This will be found in the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

## After running the app
The app consists of two pages, namely the `Upload` page and the `Query` page, all connected by one sidebar

The first page is the <strong>Upload</strong> page where the user must upload a CSV file <br>
After successfully uploading the file, the user is redirected to the <strong>Query</strong> page where they can ask questions and extract data from the uploaded CSV
